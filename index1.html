        Server replies with files, that the Browser displayes.

        <div class="description">
        <p><span class="italic">HTML - HyperText Markup Language</span> is the standart most used  programming language to
        write a web page. HTML documents include <span class="italic">text content</span> 
        (what you see) and <span class="italic">markup</span> (how it looks like).

       <div class="description"> 
       <p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. Elements are created from tags.<span class="italic">HTML tags</span> are special marks that specify the format of content. Most of tags come in pairs, means you have an opening and closing tag. Some of them are <span class="italic">void</span> and need no closing tag.</p>

        <p>Computers are just mashines, which are following a direct command of humans (programmer). Programmers are just human beings, they can make mistakes and it can drive them crazy. But it is normal, every problem has a solution. So keep calm and enjoy.</p>

  <h2>Part2: HTML, CSS and DOM</h2> 
  <div class="container2">
    <div class="concept2">
      <div class="title">CSS & DOM</div>
        <div class="description">
        <p><span class="italic">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> is a design language for electronic documents. With CSS you can determine for example layouts, colours and typography of your page. Together with <span class="italic">HTML</span> and 
        <span class="italic">DOM</span> it is the key language of a World Wide Web.
        </p>
        <p><span class="italic">Document Object Model (DOM)</span> is organized in a tree-like structure.
        Every HTML document contains three main nodes, wich are: elements, attributes and text. 
        In praxis a browser turns <span class="italic">HTML tags</span> into <span class="italic">elements</span> that form a tree. It lookes like a lot of boxes in boxes in boxes. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3555039510/m-2596138815">
        This video</a> gives you a very good explanation.
      </p>
      Example for a tree-like structure:
      <br><img src="image/Tree.jpg" alt="image">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept2">
      <div class="title">The Box Model</div>
        <div class="description">
        <span class="italic">The Box Model</span> consist of four borders, which have separate properties. These borders are:
          <ul><li>content</li>
              <li>padding</li>
              <li>border</li>
              <li>margin</li></ul>
              There are two possibilities to calculate the box size, in pixels or in percentages. If the box-size is calculated in percentages, the size of the box will changing depending of how big the screen is or encompassing the box is. When the box-size is calculated in pixels, the box will have exactly same size no matter what happens.
              <p>To adapt the width of padding and border automaticly you can use the next CSS option:
              <br>*{
                  box-sizing: border-box;
              } 
              <br><br>To be sure that all sites can display this code, you need to add some <span class="italic">browserspecific prefixes</span>. So it looks this way:
              <br>*{
              <br>-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
              <br>-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
              <br>-ms-box-sizing: border-box;
              <br>box-sizing: border-box;<br>
            }</p>
           
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept2">
      <div class="title">Code, Test, Refine<br>Avoiding repetition</div>
        <div class="description">
        Here are five main rules you sould follow by making a Web Page:
          <img src="image/CodeTest.jpg" alt="image">
          <br><br>Here are also two important links,where you can verify your HTML and CSS Codes:
          <br><a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">For HTML Code </a>
          <br><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">For CSS Code </a>
            <p>And last, but not least, there are a lot of reasons why repetition while coding should be avoiding.
            Few of them:
            <ul><li>Repetition means a lot of double work, means to write the same code over and over again. Better way is to define same classes</li>
                <li>If a programmer makes some changes in one code and does not change the style  immediately in all repeated codes, problems can occur.</li>
            </ul>
